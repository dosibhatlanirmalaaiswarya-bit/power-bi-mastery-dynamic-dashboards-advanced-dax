## DAX Code Snippets  

### YoY Growth - Executive Level  
```DAX
Executive YoY% Dynamic = 
VAR _LatestYear = 
    CALCULATE( MAX( CalendarTable[Year] ), ALL( CalendarTable ) )

VAR _PreviousYear = _LatestYear - 1

VAR _Current12MonthSales = 
    CALCULATE(
        Measures_Sales[Total Sales], 
        CalendarTable[Year] = _LatestYear,
        REMOVEFILTERS( CalendarTable )
    )

VAR _Previous12MonthSales = 
    CALCULATE(
        Measures_Sales[Total Sales], 
        CalendarTable[Year] = _PreviousYear,
        REMOVEFILTERS( CalendarTable )
    )

VAR _Result =
    IF(
        NOT(ISBLANK(_Previous12MonthSales)), 
        (_Current12MonthSales - _Previous12MonthSales) / _Previous12MonthSales, 
        BLANK()
    )

RETURN _Result
